# Stacks and Queues


## Challenge
Implement a Stack and a Queue Data Structure

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

## API

Node - has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next node.

Stack - has a top property

Push -  a method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.

Pop - a method that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.

Peek -  a method that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.

 Queue - has a top property. I

Enqueue -  a method which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.

Dequeue -  a method that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.

Peek -  a method that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
