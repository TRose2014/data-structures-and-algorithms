Define a method called print

## Challenge
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)

## API
Insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

Includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list

Print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.
