# Trees
Implement a Tree


## Challenge
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.

Create a BinaryTree class
Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.
At no time should an exception or stack trace be shown to the end user. Catch and handle any such exceptions and return a printed value or operation which cleanly represents the state and either stops execution cleanly, or provides the user with clear direction and output.

Create a BinarySearchTree class
Define a method named add that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
Define a method named contains that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(n) - Traversal
O(log n) - contains/add
O(h) - space - height 


# Breath First

# Challenge Summary
Breadth-first Traversal.

## Challenge Description
Write a breadth first traversal method which takes a Binary Tree as its unique input. 

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach; print every visited nodeâ€™s value.

# Maximum Value

# Challenge Summary
Find the Maximum Value in a Binary Tree

## Challenge Description
Write a function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. 

Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
