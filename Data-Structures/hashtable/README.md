# Hashtables

Implement a Hashtable

## Challenge
Implement a Hashtable with the following methods:

* Add: takes in both the key and value. This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* Get: takes in the key and returns the value from the table.
* Contains: takes in the key and returns a boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* Hash: takes in an arbitrary key and returns an index in the collection.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(1)
